# Riteo's kuiochai file definitions and sources.

This repository will have primarily Minecraft stuff as it's the reason I wrote
kuiochai in the first place. The sources are still pretty rough and could
benefit from a more thorough rewrite, maybe even in C. Take this as a sample
repo.

As usual, everything here is under the Unlicense and thus into the public
domain.
